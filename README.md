### Markdownscanner (TM)
Are your links broken? Let's find out: https://mdscanner.dcalvo.dev/ 
Please note that this project is under (sporadic) development and it's not finished. I just need to get around polishing a few things...

### Okay but now for real
While signing up to contribute to k8s, I found a broken link on the sign up process. [This was then my my first contribution.](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/4304)  
I then wondered: How many other markdown links are broken in open source projects? As it turns out, a lot of them.  
This tool will hopefully help me find and fix these links.

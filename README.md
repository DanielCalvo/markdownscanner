### Markdownscanner (TM)

Are your links broken? Let's find out

### Okay but now for real
While signing up to contribute to k8s, I found a broken link on the sign up process. [This was then my my first contribution.](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/4304)  
I then wondered: How many other markdown links are broken in open source projects? As it turns out, a lot of them.  
This tool will hopefully help me find and fix these links.

Please note that, at least for now, the goal of this project is exploratory in nature -- My software skills have a long way to go, and this project will hopefully help me improve. I can make no guarantees that _anything_ in here works, or is a good idea to begin with.

### Next actionable items
- Organize this in packages. That big 400 line single file isn't nice to work with.
- Go over all the comments in the code and take action on them. And clean the code up, too.
- Save the results of your scan somewhere
- Where's the web version of this project so people can browse the results over the network?
